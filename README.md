# FingerFeed

A feed aggregator for the finger protocol.

This is a bash script to allow you to browse a defined list of finger entries. The intent is to make it easy to use the finger protocol for micro-blogging.

You need to install finger on your system before running the script. 

Add your own list of finger addresses (as many as you like) to the addresses section of the script. Remove the sample addresses.

Make the script executable and run it.

The script uses less to read the entries, so you can find the navigation commands by checking the man page for less.
